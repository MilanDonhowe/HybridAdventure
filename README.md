* [Bfxr](https://www.bfxr.net/) - Sound Creation Software.  Used to make most sound effects in game.
* [Beepbox](https://www.beepbox.co/) - Web-based Chiptune Music creation tool.
* [Piskel](https://www.piskelapp.com/) - Free online pixel-based sprite editor used to make every sprite in the game.  (Besides the squares, those were made in GameMaker).

### Acknowledgements
The Following Sources were immensely helpful for the building of this game:

* [Shaun Spalding Text Boxes Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdJ0ZUIs-AI): This was probably the most useful tutorial I used.  It basically explained how to implement text boxes in a easy to understand way that I gladly abused throughout my game.
* [User "damimp"'s response to a question on r/gamemaker reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamemaker/comments/4d971s/help_how_do_i_make_an_object_float/): His answer contained the code used to actually make a random object appear floating.  It was super helpful as my own attempt at making this effect on my own led to my computer running out of memory.
* EVERYONE ELSE WHO HAS ANSWERED A QUESTION ON THE GAMEMAKER ENGINE: I inevitably will have forgot someone's tutorial or answer to a question that was used to help make this game so I will simply be thanking everyone who has actually either asked, answered or simply upvoted a question on game development.  Whether that be r/GameMaker or stackoverflow, the unity forums or the exclusive club of elite hackers at that one library, the open source community continues to be great not because of great software, but because of great people like you.  That includes whoever may be reading this.


**Word of Warning:**


The HTML version is more buggy as the game was initially made for Windows.  

I would recommend using the Windows version if you have the option.


This game was made for the 2018 GitHub GameOff Game Jam!
